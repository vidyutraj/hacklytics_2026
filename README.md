# PhishGuard

AI attacks. You defend.

PhishGuard is an AI-powered security training platform that helps employees practice spotting and responding to realistic phishing emails, vishing calls, and deepfake voice scenarios. Instead of passive compliance videos and quizzes, PhishGuard creates interactive simulations powered by generative AI — giving users hands-on experience in a safe environment.

## 🚀 The Problem

Most compliance training gets clicked through.

Employees watch a video, answer predictable quiz questions, and move on. But real-world attacks don’t look like training slides — they’re contextual, urgent, and increasingly AI-generated.

As attackers use AI to scale deception, traditional static training methods are falling behind.

## 💡 The Solution

PhishGuard modernizes compliance training by simulating AI-generated attacks and providing real-time, AI-driven feedback.

Users:

- Inspect realistic inboxes
- Analyze suspicious (but plausible) messages
- Decide how to respond (report, reply, ignore, escalate)
- Receive personalized feedback explaining their risk exposure

No memorizing bullet points. No checkbox completion. Just practical decision-making.

## 🧠 How It Works

PhishGuard uses the Google Gemini API to:

1. **Generate Threats**  
   - Context-aware phishing emails  
   - Vishing scripts  
   - Deepfake-style impersonation scenarios  

2. **Evaluate Responses**  
   The AI analyzes user decisions and provides structured coaching rather than static right/wrong grading.

Conceptually, scoring follows:

\[
\text{Score} = f(\text{threat recognition}, \text{risk assessment}, \text{action taken})
\]

This allows feedback to feel like mentorship instead of a quiz result.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- TypeScript  
- React  
- Next.js  
- Node.js  
- Google Gemini API  

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Move compliance beyond passive video modules  
- Simulate modern AI-powered threats  
- Build behavioral reflexes, not just awareness  
- Make training engaging and realistic  

---

## 🔐 Why It Matters

AI is changing the threat landscape. Phishing emails, voice cloning, and social engineering attacks are becoming easier to generate and harder to detect.

PhishGuard flips the script:

If AI can scale attacks, it can also scale preparedness.
